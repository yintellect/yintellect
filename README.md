ðŸ¤—  &nbsp; **I advocate computational literacy by providing useful content and tools for people who want to learn.**

Graduated from Columbia University, my researches focus on using [Randomized Controlled Trails](https://github.com/YiAlpha/randomization-simulation-textbook) (A/B testing) to [reduce violence against women](https://github.com/YiAlpha/media-experiment). Meanwhile, I have been injecting computation in social sciences research with [machine learning](https://github.com/YiAlpha/machine-learning-python) and [natural language processing](https://yialpha.github.io/auto-law-review).

After graduation, I joined [Wolfram Research](https://www.wolfram.com/), the creator of Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha to advocate computational tools for scholarly research and civic literacy.

Computational literacy is essential in the 21st century. Therefore, I served as vice president at [Society for Quantitative Approaches to Social Research](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/qasr/) from 2019 to 2020 and hosted workshops for [data wrangling](https://yialpha.github.io/data-wrangling-r), [web scraping](https://yialpha.github.io/web-scrape-workshop/), and [visualizations](https://yialpha.github.io/data-visualization-r) during my tenure. Besides, I have been a consultant for a [Data Journalism Program at Columbia](http://ledeprogram.com/), helping journalists with statistical inferences, computation techniques, and storytelling with data.
